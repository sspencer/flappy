# Flappy Dragon

For the last week of 2021, purchased [Hands-on Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/) and am following along with the tutorial.  This program implements a flappy bird type game in a terminal-like screen using [ASCII Code page 437](https://www.ascii-codes.com/).

## Building

* Check source with: `cargo clippy`
* Run code with: `cargo run`
